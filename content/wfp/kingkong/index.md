1. Download and extract the archive to the game directory, where the exe is located.
2. Check the download link below for all available features.

Notes:

* Only works with Gamer's Edition, Signature Edition is not compatible.
* Includes d3d9 wrapper that limits frame rate to 60fps to avoid game-breaking bugs. You can set limit to 30fps via d3d9.ini.
