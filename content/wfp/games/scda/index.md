1. Download and extract the archive to the game directory, where the exe is located.
2. Check the download link below for all available features.

Notes:

* Includes special d3d9 wrapper that prevents the game from crashing after certain events occur. Instead of the crash, loadscreens may disappear, minimap will be bugged, but you'll be able to save your progress and restart the game.
