1. Download and extract the archive to the game directory, where the game exe is located.

* Includes [dgVoodoo](http://dege.freeweb.hu/dgVoodoo2/) to fix some game issues. However, dgVoodoo introduces more issues like invisible cutscene borders and crashes after loading a level, so you might not want to use it.
